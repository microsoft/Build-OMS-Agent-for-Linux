# The following is a metadata section that describes the versioning scheme and basic version datacenter to use. This data will be used to
# generate content in the .version folder for use by your custom versioning steps.
# In fact, in this sample, a file named .version\PipelineAssemblyInfo.cs will be generated that contains the following code (ignore the actual
# versions because those are dummy values).
#
# // This is a CDPX pipeline generated file
# using System.Reflection;
# [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.060517.1000")]
# [assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.060517.1000")]
# [assembly: AssemblyInformationalVersion("1.0.060517.1000-test-31f791f1")]
#
# The key point is that this file is not checked in by CDPX. So, we check in a dummy file with similar content and add this file as a compile
# item with a link. When the code is built in CDPX, the file is first overwritten with actual version numbers. Thus, when the code compiles,
# the new version numbers are picked up.
#
# Obviously, this may not work for everyone. So, in addition to these template files, CDPX writes out several info files whose content is some
# part of the version number. Which part is hinted at by the name of the file.
# For example, package.semantic.info will contain patch semantic version number in the form 1.0.MMddyyrrrr-tag-commit.
